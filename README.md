# Sneks
A hyper-realistic snek simulator.

```
sneks.exe options:

-c      --count Count of sneks to display, default is 1 (more sneks = more lag)
-d      --delay Delay (in seconds) until the sneks appear (0-86400)
-h      --help  Show this message and exit
```

To close it, simply press Alt+F4. Alternatively, you can also just kill the `sneks.exe` process. But do you really wanna kill the sneks?!?  (I know my mother would)
